      <h1 class="w3-padding-32">Stochastic Thermodynamics</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-black">
          A common theme to my research is stochastic
  thermodynamics. It uses the mathematical language of stochastic
  processes to model the evolution of the state of a system and of
  observables like heat, work or entropy. Importantly, a stochastic
  dynamics needs to be constrained by the underlying laws of physics. One
  can then explore how these physical constraints genrally shape the
  statistics of observables.

      <h3 class="w3-padding-32" id="TUR">Thermodynamics of precision</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-black">
      Driven systems in a thermal environment can be characterised by
      their uptake of energy and by the precision observed for some
      output variable. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR)
      expresses a trade-off between these quantities: Precision comes
      at a minimal energetic cost. I have contributed to the
      mathematical understanding of this relation in terms of large
      deviation theory. Moreover, some of my work explores the
      implications of the TUR for a variety of systems, such as heat
      engines, molecular motors, or clocks. The TUR holds true for
      systems on microscopic scales, but, as a simple model for a
      pendulum clock reveals, inertial dynamics on macroscopic scales
      can lead to precision beyond the limits set by the TUR.

      <h3 class="w3-padding-32" id="AM">Active matter</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-black">
       Active matter is a class of non-equilibrium systems, which
      consist of independently self-driven particles. Following the
      principles of stochastic thermodynamics, we can characterise the
      energetic properties of active matter systems. I am particularly
      interested in how active matter interacts with passive
      surroundings, how these interactions can be used to design
      engines working with active matter, and how efficient such
      engines can be.

      In response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have
      contributed to the programme <i>Rapid assistance in modelling
      the pandemic</i> (<a
      href="https://epcced.github.io/ramp/">RAMP</a>). I have worked
      on the inference of models and model parameters from data,
      taking into account statistical fluctuations and systematic
      errors due to changing testing capacities. I was a core
      developer of the <a
      href="https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross"> PyRoss software
      package</a> and have used this software to infer changes in the
      disease dynamics from publicly available data.

    <hr> <h3 class="w3-padding-32" id="FT">Fluctuation theorems</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-black"> Fluctuation theorems are classic
      results of stochastic thermodynamics. They compare forward
      fluctuations of observables related to entropy production with
      their exponentially less likely backward
      fluctuations. Applications of fluctuation theorems often require
      the observation of all degrees of freedom of a system. In my
      work I have explored ways to put fluctuation theorems to use in
      scenarios where some relevant degrees of freedom cannot be
      observed.  </p> <img width="50%" src="img/gfunc.png">
